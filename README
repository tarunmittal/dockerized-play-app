This is your new Play application. The details are as below:
=================================

- Play version: 2.3.9
- Database integration (MySql)
- ORM: JPA (basedao has been created)
- Evolutions plugin has been integrated. In conf/evolution/1.sql, add any sql and it will be executed on project start. Subsequently add 2.sql, 3.sql etc.
- Amazon util has been included.
- 3DES encryption is included too. Change the encryption key in app/util/encryption/TripleDESEncryption.java
	- To encrypt any String in the project, use String encryptedString = EncryptionFactory.getInstance().encrypt("encryptme");
	- To decrypt it back use, Sting decryptedString = EncryptionFactory.getInstance().encrypt(encryptedString);
- To create the docker image of your app, use buildscript (./buildscript after chmod +x buildscript). 
	-It will run a clean compile stage and copy the executable project jar, dependency and configuration to dist folder, which will then be included in the container.
- Launch script to launch the docker container. Add as many as configurable variables as required.
